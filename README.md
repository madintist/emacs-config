# Emacs Config

Just my custom Emacs configuration. I'll add more notes about the setup here as I build it out.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo into your home directory
2. If you have an existing `.emacs` file that you want to save make sure to back it up somewhere besides your home directory.
3. Run the `init.sh` script in the repo. This will symlink the `.emacs` file from this repo into your home directory.

## Packages

Here's a list of packages / extensions that are used in this build:

- [Evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)
  - Vim layer
- [Helm](https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/)
  - For finding files, command autocompletion, etc.
- [Magit](https://magit.vc/)
  - Git interface for Emacs.
  
## Modes

And here's the list of language modes that have been added:

- [js2-mode](https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode)
- [markdown-mode](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/)
