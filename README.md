# Emacs Config

Just my custom Emacs configuration. I'll add more notes about the setup here as I build it out.

## Modes

These are the langage modes that I've added:

- [js2-mode](https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode)
  - *.js, *.jsx
- [json-mode](https://github.com/joshwnj/json-mode)
  - *.json
- [markdown-mode](https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/)
  - *.md, *.markdown
- [php-mode](https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode)
  - *.php, *.inc
- [web-mode](http://web-mode.org/)
  - *.phtml, *tpl.php, *.ascx, *.aspx, *.erb, *.mustache, *.djhtml, *.htm, *.hmtl, *.css

## Packages

- [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package)
  - This loads/installs all of our packages automatically.
  - Also makes config way easier and far more consistent.
