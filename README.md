# Emacs Config

Just my custom Emacs configuration. I'll add more notes about the setup here as I build it out.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo into your home directory
2. If you have an existing `.emacs` file that you want to save make sure to back it up somewhere besides your home directory.
3. Run the `init.sh` script in the repo. This will symlink the `.emacs` file from this repo into your home directory.
